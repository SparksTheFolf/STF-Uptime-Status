This repository contains the open-source uptime monitor and status page for [Sparks](https://status.wuffs.net), powered by [Upptime](https://github.com/upptime/upptime).

With [Upptime](https://upptime.js.org), you can get your own unlimited and free uptime monitor and status page, powered entirely by a GitHub repository. We use [Issues](https://github.com/SparksTheFolf/STF-Uptime-Status/issues) as incident reports, [Actions](https://github.com/SparksTheFolf/STF-Uptime-Status/actions) as uptime monitors, and [Pages](https://status.wuffs.net) for the status page.
